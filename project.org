* Steps

1. Build your app
2. Demo for class (last day of class)
3. ???
4. Profit!

* What kind of app?

  Whatever you'd like! We've talked about some stuff in class
  already. Please feel free to dig on in.

* What do you demo?

  Some combination of slides/talk and live app usage.

** Components of the demo

   - User stories!
     - As close to a full list of the high level/30,000 ft ones
     - A handful of the next level or two down (very specific, single
       actions
       - Especially the ones you plan to demonstrate with the app
         itself.
   - What did you use to build your app.
     - You absolutely do *not* have to start from scratch like we did
       for class. Please feel free to use any existing packages,
       libraries, or seed projects, just be sure to mention it.
   - What you built yourself
     - Tell us about the code you wrote. Did you use any techniques we
       covered in class? Did you need to go learn something additional
       to make it work?
     - Tell us about the problems you solved. What did you expect to
       have to solve? What surprised you? What are you particular
       proud of getting working?
   - "Metrics" (could just be a single slide in your presentation if
     you'd like)
     - Total number of npm/bower packages used
     - Total number of lines of code written
     - Total number of lines of test written
     - Coverage percentages
       - Angular/front-end
       - Express/back-end
     - Total number of git commits
     - Anything else you'd like to share

** Outside of the demo itself

   - Repository on GitHub (or elsewhere, if you have a strong
     preference; it just needs to be available). And in that repository:
     - Code (duh!)
     - Tests
       - Front-end unit tests
       - Back-end unit tests
       - Protractor integration tests
     - Gulp (or other build system) setup

   - Live application running in production somewhere. It doesn't have
     to be on Heroku, but it has to /not/ be your laptop.
